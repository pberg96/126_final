        <h2><u>General Hiking questions:</u></h2>
        <h3>Q: How hard is it to hike in the NC Mountains?</h3>
        <p>A: The answer is up to you. Depending on how prepared you are, your trip can be a vacation or a challenge, a revelation or an ordeal. The majority of NC hikers are here for the first time, and although many are avid hikers, they find that hiking in NC is very different from most other hiking experiences. They tend to react to the experience in one of two ways, either they can't wait to get back, or they swear they will never do it again.</p>
        <h3>Q: How long will my hike take?</h3>
      <p>A: Monitor the amount of time it takes you to get down to any location; it can take twice that amount of time to cover the same distance going out. This "rule of thumb" seems to work well regardless of individual fitness, age and/or length of stride. Most first-time Grand Canyon hikers walk uphill at an average speed of one mile per hour.
      </p>
        <h3>Q: Should I hike alone?</h3>
        <p>A: Risks are greater for those who hike alone. There is no one to assist you if you become lost, ill, or injured. Hikers traveling alone are at greater risk of attack. Be sure to keep your group together; a good plan is to have your most skilled members at the front and rear of your group with the novices in the middle.</p>
        <h3>Q: Are there toilets in the NC mountains?</h3>
        <p>A: There are very few. Not all campsites have toilet facilities. Be prepared to provide your own toilet paper. Where toilets are available, you must use them. Only human waste and toilet paper should be deposited in the toilets. Where toilets are not available you must carry out your used toilet paper (a plastic ziplock bag works well) and bury feces in a small hole about 6 in / 15 cm deep. Be sure you are at least 200 ft / 60 m from trails, campsites, and water sources. </p>
        <h2><u>Equipment Questions:</u></h2>
        <h3>Q: Do I need a map?</h3>
        <p>A: A map is essential for planning a trip and staying oriented during your hike. Overnight hikers on trails will be able to hike safely with the general map they will get with their permit but topographic maps are needed anywhere else. Appalachian topographic maps are available for purchase from the Appalachain trail association.</p>
        <h3>Q: Do I need a tent?</h3>
        <p>A: When hiking in the NC Mountains, it is desirable to travel as light as is reasonable. Rain is most likely to occur during the spring and summer months. A tent can offer protection from rain. During summer consider taking a lighter sleeping bag (or even a sheet) to save weight if you decide to carry a tent. Another option is to take only the rain fly or a bivy sack as shelter. During winter, tents are desirable equipment as well to stay warm!</p>
        <h3>Q: Do I need a Stove?</h3>
        <p>A: You need to balance the weight of a stove and fuel against your desire for hot meals. During the heat of summer, cold meals are often more attractive. During cold weather, a stove may be important for survival. Fires are prohibited throughout the backcountry.</p>
        <h2><u>Wild Animals:</u></h2>
        <h3>Q: Is there danger from wild animals sch as bears and snakes?</h3>
        <p>A: Although there are many wild animals on the trail including bears, snakes, and wild boars, the fear of these animals is unnecessary. All hikers should take certain precautions to protect themselves and their food, such as hanging food in bear bags, but there is little worry of these animals causing any serious harm.</p>
